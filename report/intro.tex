Virtual private networks (VPN) are crucial in modern era.
By encapsulating and sending client's traffic inside protected
tunnels it is possible for users to obtain network services,
which otherwise would be blocked by network operator.
VPN solutions are also useful when accessing company’s Intranet
network. For example, corporate employees can access internal
network in a secure way by establishing a VPN connection and
directing all traffic through the tunnel towards the corporate
network. This way they can get services, which otherwise
would be impossible to get from the outside world.
