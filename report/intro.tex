Virtual private networks (VPN) are crucial in the modern era. 
By encapsulating and sending client's traffic inside protected 
tunnels it is possible for users to obtain network services, 
which otherwise would be blocked by a network operator. VPN 
solutions are also useful when accessing a company’s Intranet 
network. For example, corporate employees can access the 
internal network in a secure way by establishing a VPN connection 
and directing all traffic through the tunnel towards the corporate 
network. This way they can get services, which otherwise would 
be impossible to get from the outside world.
