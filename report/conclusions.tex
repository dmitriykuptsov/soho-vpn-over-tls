\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusion}

In this short report, we have made an attempt to describe how VPN 
solutions can be blocked by network operators. We argued that VPN 
traffic can still be hidden from observers, by masking the tunnels 
using TLS protocol. Our experiments suggest that this approach is 
handy when there is a need for a secure channel, but network operators 
are eager to block VPN traffic.

Although it is hard to make a business with this solution (in the long 
run, network operators can simply block all IP addresses which belong 
to VPN servers, hosted by a business), we argue, however, that people 
can use this software and deploy it on their own cloud machines (they 
can keep the IP addresses of the servers in secret). In this way there 
is little chance that network operators can pinpoint the IP addresses of the 
servers: (i) the traffic will look like normal HTTPS traffic (at the end
the SSL tunnel is used using default HTTPS ports); (ii) it is a rather 
complex task for network operators to scan through all IP addresses and 
find those, which are used to send VPN traffic.

We made the software available for download on a GitHub page. We hope that 
this project can make the Internet more liberal in certain countries.
