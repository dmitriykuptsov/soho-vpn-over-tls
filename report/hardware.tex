\section{Hardware and software}

To implement the VPN client and server we have used Python framework. The implementation
consists roughly $1.2$K lines of code (LOC) and all functions are realized in userspace.
We have exposed the implementation in our git repository~\ref{impl}, so that everyone can use it 
without any fee.

During the experiments, however, we have considered the following setup.
For hardware we have selected a micro instance from DigitalOcean. The instance had 
single core CPU, $25$ GB of data storage, $1$GB of random access memory, and was 
located in New York, USA. The VPN client was located in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and was
spinning on Raspberry PI microcontroller. This way we mimiced the SOHO router. We have 
also used iperf tool to measure the throughput, and we have used ping utility to 
measure the round trip times.
