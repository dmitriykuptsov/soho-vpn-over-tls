To implement the VPN client and server we have used the Python 
framework and Ubuntu Linux distribution. The implementation consists 
of roughly $1.2$K lines of code (LOC) and all functions are realized 
in userspace. We have exposed the implementation in our git 
repository~\cite{impl} so that everyone can use it without any fee.

During the experiments, however, we have considered the following setup. 
For hardware, we have selected a micro instance from DigitalOcean. The 
instance had a single-core CPU, $25$ GB of data storage, $1$GB of random 
access memory, and was located in New York, USA. The VPN client was located 
in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and was spinning on Raspberry PI microcontroller. 
This way we mimicked the SOHO router. We have also used iperf tool to measure 
the throughput, and we have used ping utility to measure the round trip times.
