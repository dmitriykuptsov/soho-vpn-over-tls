\section{Hardware and software}
\label{sec:hardware}

To implement the VPN client and server we have used Python framework. The implementation
consists roughly $1.2$K LOC and all functions are realized in userspace.

During the experiments, however, we have considered the following setup.
For hardware we have selected a micro instance from UpCloud. The instance had 
single core CPU, $25$ GB of data storage, $1$GB of random access memory, and was 
located in Frankfurt, Germany. The client machine was located in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. 
For software we have selected (on both ends) Ubuntu 18.04. We have also used iperf tool 
to measure the throughput, and we have used ping utility to measure the round trip times.
