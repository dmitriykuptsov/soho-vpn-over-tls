In Figure~\ref{fig:arch} we show the general view of the architecture, 
and in Figure~\ref{fig:topo} we demonstrate the topology of the SOHO network

Figure~\ref{fig:prototype} we show working prototype.

We have made several experiments over the course of our work. The very first experiment was 
related to sending ping messages towards the VPN TLS server and observing the differences in
round trip times (basically, we have compared the round trip times between the setting in 
which tunnel was present and the setting in which the tunnel did not exist). Next, we have
sat down to measure the throughput between the local and remote machine. Basically, we have 
performed $50$ measurements for a setting, in which the traffic was going inside the tunnel
and the same number of measurements for the setting, in which the traffic was going 
normally (meaning, unencrypted and not encapsulated in TLS packets). To measure throughput,
we have used \texttt{iperf} tool.

In Figure~\ref{fig:rtt} we show the distribution of round-trip times
(RTT). Mean RTT for VPN connection was $293.7$ ms, and mean RTT for 
plain ICMP was $103.3$ ms.

        \caption{Distribution of RTTs}
        \label{fig:rtt}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:iperf_distr} we show the distribution of the obtained throughput for both
TLS protected tunnel and regular TCP connections. Mean throughput value for the VPN connection was 
$848.7$ Kb/s, and mean throughput for plain TCP connection was $554.8$ Kb/s. The distributions 
look almost identical. Given these results, we think that in this case the bottleneck is SOHO
connection to the Internet and not our implementation of the software. In other words, 
our implementation of VPN tunnel is good enough for most small office settings.

Finally, we have made a successful experiment in which the tunnel was used for a long period of time
without interruption (the tunnel was used for several days).
